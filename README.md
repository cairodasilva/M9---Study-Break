# M9---Study-Break

Brief Overview
This project was made to serve as a study break during times where students are working really hard and they can mess around and make some alright looking art to show their friends and then really easily clear it and go back to work.
To use it you first need to make a background, do this by moving the mouse horizontally to change the pattern and vertically to change the color. Then when you like it that way it is, press x. Now that you have a cool background, click and drag the mouse around to make a little drawing, notice the symettry? If you want a bigger brush press the up arrow, pressing the down arrow decreases the brush size. Press space to change the color of the brush to a new color. Are you done? press x again to clear the background and restart from the beginning.

The users are casually creating a really cool background and then drawing over it symmetrically. I keep them engaged by having a really fluid way to change the background so you can just play around with that without even drawing. I help them make something thats easy to pause and then show a firend whos right there because things are really easy to make and they're also really easy to clear so you can just try and try again.

This system is personally meaningful to me because in addition to study EOS and computer science, I also accidentally got a minor in Math and really like math. This project used some really cool math to make the background and it really represents some cool aspects of what you can do with sin and cosine. It was also really fun to play with while I was studying for finals which has been a lot these past few weeks..

This project challenged me at a programmer because I had never used processing before and I also had to try a lot of different functions to make the background look good as well as have an interesting color scheme. The next steps going forward would be have a slider or something to change the background color scheme, because I change the hue and brightness, but not the saturation. 
There aren't any bugs that I can think of, but sometimes when you first try to pause the background with 'x' it doenst work and you just need to click a few times and it should work.
  I didn't use any external sources, but I was inspired by many of the examples and learned a lot from this one https://processing.org/examples/graphing2dequation.html
